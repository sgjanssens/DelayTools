# DelayTools
A Maple package for the analysis of delay equations

## Description

In this package I collect a number of Maple procedures that I have found useful for symbolic and numerical analysis of delayed dynamical systems. For now, the focus is on local stability and bifurcation in so-called classical *delay differential equations*. The aim is to extend the coverage to other types of delay equations such as purely functional (renewal) equations and mixed systems.

## Installation
1. Use Maple to open, edit (if necessary) and run the `build.mpl` file contained in the repository root.
1. Make sure your [initialization file](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=worksheet/reference/initialization) is correct.
1. Exit, restart and test for success by entering `with(DelayTools)` at the prompt.

Please let me know if you encounter difficulties.

## Usage
Documentation and examples will be made available [on my site](http://sebastiaanjanssens.nl/delay/) where LaTeX is more easily used.
